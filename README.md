Advancements are one of the core features of Minecraft, and have been widely sought-out to modify and develop with. With a lack of understanding and documentation, it can be difficult to create custom advancements. 

This API serves to solve this by creating a simple and easy-to-use API that supports all versions of Minecraft where they exist, 1.12.2 and above. Featuring Bukkit, Spigot, and Paper support, this API is designed to be as flexible as possible, allowing for easy developing.
